***1. What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?***

Our target is column **IS_SUCCESSFUL**

***2. What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?***

**Initial model**

| APPLICATION_TYPE | AFFILIATION | CLASSIFICATION | USE_CASE | ORGANIZATION | STATUS | INCOME_AMT | SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS | ASK_AMT |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Optimized Model** - with the highest accuracy includes colum NAME

| **NAME** | APPLICATION_TYPE | AFFILIATION | CLASSIFICATION | USE_CASE | ORGANIZATION | STATUS | INCOME_AMT | SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS | ASK_AMT |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |




***3. What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?***

* Initial model - **EIN** and **NAME**
* Optimized model - **EIN** only (after testing multiple scenarios (see image below)

#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

***4. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?***

***5. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?***

***6. What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?***
