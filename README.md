***1. What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?***

y

***2. What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?***

***3. What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?***

#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

***4. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?***

***5. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?***
